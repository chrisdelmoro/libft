- If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work
won’t have to be submitted and won’t be graded. It will give you a chance
to easily test your work and your peers’ work. You will find those tests especially
useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests
and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.

- If you need helper functions to split a more complex function, define them as static
functions. This way, their scope will be limited to the appropriate file.

- Place all your files at the root of your repository.
